### Chapter 5 Machine Learning Basics

- Definition of Meachine Learning by Mitchell: A computer program that learns Experience E with respect to Task T and Performance P
  - Experience E 
    - Most machine learning algorithms simply experience a dataset. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are in turn collections of features.
    - With these kinds of learning algorithms: Unsupervised Learning / Supervised Learning / Reinforcement Learning
